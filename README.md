## By Ezerioha Ifeanyi Emmanuel

## Dataset
https://maven-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/Pizza+Place+Sales/Pizza+Place+Sales.zip

A year's worth of sales from a fictitious pizza place, including the date and time of each order and the pizzas served, with additional details on the type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients.

### This analysis seeks to answer the following questions:
- What day of the week are vehicles most often and least often stolen?
- What types of vehicles are most often and least often stolen? Does this vary by region?
- What is the average age of the vehicles that are stolen? Does this vary based on the vehicle type?
- Which regions have the most and least number of stolen vehicles? What are the characteristics of the regions?

## Data Cleaning Process:
A lot of data manipulation was done to clean the dataset and prepare it for data analysis.
